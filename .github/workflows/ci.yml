  # Run the integration, find and mapreduce tests using pouchdb-server as the
  # remote adapter. This checks that pouchdb-server works with the current
  # PouchDB source tree. We run this on Node.js and on every target browser.
  # Running against different versions of Node.js might require splitting this
  # out into a distinct job.
