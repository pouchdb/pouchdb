// `findPathToLeaf()` returns an array of revs that goes from the specified
// leaf rev to the root of that leaf’s branch.
//
// eg. for this rev tree:
// 1-9692 ▶ 2-37aa ▶ 3-df22 ▶ 4-6e94 ▶ 5-df4a ▶ 6-6a3a ▶ 7-57e5
//          ┃                 ┗━━━━━━▶ 5-8d8c ▶ 6-65e0
//          ┗━━━━━━▶ 3-43f6 ▶ 4-a3b4
//
// For a `targetRev` of '7-57e5', `findPathToLeaf()` would return ['7-57e5', '6-6a3a', '5-df4a']
// The `revs` arument has the same structure as what `revs_tree` has on e.g.
// the IndexedDB representation of the rev tree datastructure. Please refer to
// tests/unit/test.purge.js for examples of what these look like.
//
// This function will throw an error if:
// - The requested revision does not exist
// - The requested revision is not a leaf
