CouchDB was designed with one main goal in mind &ndash; sync. Jason Smith has [a great quote](http://nodeup.com/thirtyseven) about this:

> The way I like to think about CouchDB is this: CouchDB is bad at everything, except syncing. And it turns out that's the most important feature you could ever ask for, for many types of software."

When you first start using CouchDB, you may become frustrated because it doesn't operate quite like other databases. Unlike many other databases, CouchDB requires you to explicitly manage document revisions (`_rev`), which can be tedious.

However, CouchDB was designed with sync in mind, and this is exactly what it excels at. Many of the rough edges of the API serve this larger purpose. For instance, managing your document revisions pays off in the future, when you eventually need to start dealing with conflicts.

CouchDB sync
------

CouchDB sync (aka replication) has a unique design. Rather than relying on a master/slave architecture, CouchDB
supports a **multi-master** architecture. You can think of this as a system where any node can be written to or read from, and where you don't have to care which one is the "master"
and which one is the "slave." In CouchDB's egalitarian world, every citizen is as worthy as another.

When you write web applications with PouchDB, or when you write mobile apps using the Couchbase/Cloudant mobile libraries for iOS and Android, you
don't have to worry which database is the "single source of truth." They all are. According to the CAP theorem, CouchDB is an AP database, meaning that it's **P**artitioned, 
every node is **A**vailable, and it's only eventually **C**onsistent.

To illustrate, imagine a multi-node architecture with CouchDB servers spread across several continents. As long as you're willing to wait, the data will eventually flow 
from Australia to Europe to North America to wherever. Users around the world running PouchDB in their browsers or the Couchbase/Cloudant mobile libraries smartphones experience the 
same privileges. The data won't show up instantaneously, but depending on the Internet connection speed, it's usually close enough to real-time.

In cases of conflict, CouchDB will choose an arbitrary winner that every node can agree upon deterministically. However, conflicts are still stored in the **revision tree** (similar to a Git history tree), which means that app developers can either surface the conflicts to the user, or just ignore them.

In this way, CouchDB replication "just works."

Setting up sync
-----------

As you already know, you can create either local PouchDBs:

```js
var localDB = new PouchDB('mylocaldb')
```

or remote PouchDBs:

```js
var remoteDB = new PouchDB('http://localhost:5984/myremotedb')
```

This comes in handy when you want to share data between the two between the two.

The simplest case is **unidirectional replication**, meaning you just want one databse to replicate to another one.

```js
localDB.replicate.to(remoteDB);
```

Congratulations, all changes from the `localDB` have been replicated to the `remoteDB`.

However, what if you want **bidirectional replication**? (Kinky!) You could do:

```js
localDB.replicate.to(remoteDB);
localDB.replicate.from(remoteDB);
```

However, to make things easier for your poor tired fingers, we have created a shortcut API:

```js
localDB.sync.to(remoteDB);
```

These two statements are equivalent.

Live sync
---------

Live replication (or live sync) is a separate mode where changes are propagated between the two databases as the changes occur. In other words, non-live replication happens once, whereas live replication happens in real time.

To enable live replication, you simply specify `{live: true}`:

```js
localDB.sync.to(remoteDB, {live: true});
```

However, there is one little gotcha with live replication: what if the user goes offline? In those cases, an error will be thrown, and you'll want to restart the replication process.

Luckily. PouchDB provides a way to do this:

```js
localDB.sync.to(remoteDB, {live: true}).on('change', function (change) {
  // yo, something changed!
}).on('error', function (err) {
  // yo, we got an error!
})));
```

When that `'error'` function is invoked, it's usually because of a network error. That means you can easily set up an infinite retry mechanism:

```js
function retryReplication() {
  localDB.sync.to(remoteDB, {live: true}).on('change', function (change) {
    // yo, something changed!
  }).on('error', function (err) {
    setTimeout(retryReplication, 5000);
  })));
}
```
