PouchDB is not a self-contained database; it is a CouchDB-style abstraction layer over other databases. By default, PouchDB ships with the [IndexedDB][] adapter for the browser, and a [LevelDB][] adapter in Node.js. This can be visualized as so:

<object data="static/svg/pouchdb_adapters.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
    <img src="static/img/pouchdb_adapters.png" alt="adapters">
</object>

PouchDB attempts to provide a consistent API that "just works" across every browser and JavaScript environment, and in most cases, you can just use the defaults. However, if you're trying to reach the widest possible audience, or if you want the best performance, then you will sometimes want to tinker with the adapter settings.

In the browser, PouchDB prefers IndexedDB.

{% include alert/start.html variant="info"%}
Prior to PouchDB 7.0.0, the WebSQL adapter was used for Safari/iOS. The WebSQL adapter no longer ships in PouchDB, but may be installed separately.
{% include alert/end.html%}

If you're ever curious which adapter is being used in a particular browser, you can use the following method:

```js
var pouch = new PouchDB('myDB');
console.log(pouch.adapter); // prints 'idb'
```

### SQLite plugin for Cordova/PhoneGap

On Cordova/PhoneGap/Ionic, the native SQLite database is often a popular choice, because it allows unlimited storage (compared to [IndexedDB/WebSQL storage limits](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/offline/quota-research)). It also offers more flexibility in backing up and pre-loading databases, because the SQLite files are directly accessible to app developers.

There are various Cordova plugins that can provide access to native SQLite, such as 
[Cordova-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage),    
[cordova-plugin-sqlite-2](https://github.com/nolanlawson/cordova-plugin-sqlite-2), or 
[cordova-plugin-websql](https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-websql).

To use them, you must install them separately into your Cordova application, and then add a special third-party PouchDB adapter
called [pouchdb-adapter-cordova-sqlite](https://github.com/nolanlawson/pouchdb-adapter-cordova-sqlite). Once you do
that, you can use it via:

```js
var db = new PouchDB('myDB.db', {adapter: 'cordova-sqlite'});
```

{% include alert/start.html variant="info"%}
In PouchDB pre-6.0.0, Cordova SQLite support was available out-of-the-box, but it has been moved to a separate plugin
to reduce confusion and to make it explicit whether you are using WebSQL or Cordova SQLite.
{% include alert/end.html%}

We recommend avoiding Cordova SQLite unless you are hitting the 50MB storage limit in iOS, you 
require native or preloaded access to the database files, or there's some other reason to go native.
The built-in IndexedDB adapter is nearly always more performant and stable.

### Browser adapter plugins

PouchDB also offers separate browser plugins that use backends other than IndexedDB. These plugins fully pass the PouchDB test suite and are rigorously tested in our CI process.

**Downloads:**

These plugins add a hefty footprint due to external dependencies, so take them with a grain of salt.

#### In-memory adapter

If you want a quick database for your unit tests, you can use the `pouchdb.memory.js` plugin, which offers a pure in-memory PouchDB:

```html
<script src="pouchdb.js"></script>
<script src="pouchdb.memory.js"></script>
<script>
  // this pouch is ephemeral; it only exists in memory
  var pouch = new PouchDB('mydb', {adapter: 'memory'});
</script>
```

This pouch will act exactly like a normal one &ndash; replicating, storing attachments, pagination, etc. &ndash; but it will be deleted as soon as the user closes their browser. However, multiple `PouchDB` objects with the same database name will share the same data:

```js
// pouch1 and pouch2 will share the same data
var pouch1 = new PouchDB('myDB', {adapter: 'memory'});
var pouch2 = new PouchDB('myDB', {adapter: 'memory'});

// pouch3 will have its own data
var pouch3 = new PouchDB('myOtherDB', {adapter: 'memory'});
```

#### LocalStorage adapter

If you need to support very old browsers, such as IE &le; 9.0 and Opera Mini, you can use the `pouchdb.localstorage.js` plugin, which allows PouchDB to fall back to [LocalStorage][] on browsers that don't support either IndexedDB or WebSQL.  The [es5-shims][] will also be necessary.

```html
<script src="pouchdb.js"></script>
<script src="pouchdb.localstorage.js"></script>
<script>
  // this pouch is backed by LocalStorage
  var pouch = new PouchDB('mydb', {adapter: 'localstorage'});
</script>
```

{% include alert/start.html variant="warning"%}
The LocalStorage plugin should be considered highly experimental, and the underlying structure may change in the future.  Currently it stores all document IDs in memory, which works fine on small databases but may crash on larger databases.  You can follow <a href='https://github.com/No9/localstorage-down'>localstorage-down</a> to track our progress.
{% include alert/end.html %}

#### In-memory

Just as in the browser, you can also create a pure in-memory PouchDB:

```
$ npm install pouchdb-adapter-memory
```

then:

```js
PouchDB.plugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-memory'));
var pouch = new PouchDB('myDB', {adapter: 'memory'});
```

This implementation is based on [MemDOWN](https://github.com/level/memdown), and will not write any changes to disk.

#### Node SQLite adapter

You can also use PouchDB over [SQLite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3) in Node, using the WebSQL adapter and
[node-websql](https://github.com/nolanlawson/node-websql):

```js
var PouchDB = require('pouchdb');
PouchDB.plugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-node-websql'));

var db = new PouchDB('mydatabase.db', {adapter: 'websql'});
```

In this case, PouchDB is directly using SQLite queries to build the database, exactly as the WebSQL adapter would.

See ["Prebuilt databases with PouchDB"]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/04/28/prebuilt-databases-with-pouchdb.html)
for a guide to how you might use this adapter to create prebuilt SQLite database files for adapters such as Cordova or Electron.

#### Other LevelDOWN adapters

Technically you are free to use
[any LevelDOWN-based implementation](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup/wiki/Modules#storage-back-ends) in either Node or the browser.
However this should be considered **extremely experimental** and not designed for production use.

See [pouchdb-adapter-leveldb-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pouchdb-adapter-leveldb-core) for details.

{% include anchor.html title="PouchDB over HTTP" hash="pouchdb_over_http"%}

In both the browser and in Node.js, PouchDB can also function as a straightforward API on top of any [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/)-compliant database:

```js
var pouch = new PouchDB('http://my-site.com:5984/my-db');
var securePouch = new PouchDB('https://my-secure-site.com:5984/my-secure-db');
```

You can also sync to and from these databases to your local PouchDB.

Currently PouchDB has full support for:

* CouchDB 1.x ([tested in CI](https://travis-ci.org/pouchdb/pouchdb))
* [Smileupps](https://www.smileupps.com/) (same as 1.x)
* CouchDB 2.x ([tested in CI](https://travis-ci.org/pouchdb/pouchdb))
* [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/) (roughly the same as 2.x)
* [PouchDB Server](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server) ([tested in CI](https://travis-ci.org/pouchdb/pouchdb))
* [PouchDB Server --in-memory mode](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server) ([tested in CI](https://travis-ci.org/pouchdb/pouchdb))

[Drupal 8](http://wearepropeople.com/blog/a-content-staging-solution-for-drupal-8-and-more) has also announced support for PouchDB, and there is [rcouch](https://github.com/rcouch/rcouch) as well, but these are both untested by PouchDB.

If you are ever unsure about a server, consider replicating from PouchDB to CouchDB, then from that CouchDB to the other server.

#### PouchDB Server

[PouchDB Server](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server) is a standalone REST server that implements the CouchDB API, while using a LevelDB-based PouchDB under the hood. It also supports an `--in-memory` mode and any [LevelDOWN][] adapter, which you may find handy.

PouchDB Server passes the PouchDB test suite at 100%, but be aware that it is not as full-featured or battle-tested as CouchDB.

#### PouchDB Express

The underlying module for PouchDB Server, [Express PouchDB](https://github.com/pouchdb/express-pouchdb) is an Express submodule that mimics most of the CouchDB API within your Express application.
