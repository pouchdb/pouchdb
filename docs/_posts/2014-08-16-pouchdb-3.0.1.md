[PouchDB 3.0.1](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases/tag/3.0.1) is a patch release to fix a migration bug in PouchDB 3.0.0 ([#2456](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2456)). Please upgrade your existing users directly from 2.2.3 and do not use 3.0.0.

This release also contains a small performance boost for `bulkDocs()` ([#2553](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2553)).
