title: PouchDB 7.3.0
author: Alba Herrer√≠as

---

We're happy to announce the release of PouchDB 7.3.0, bringing in features, fixes and dependency updates. For a full changelog from 7.2.2 to 7.3.0, please see [the releases page](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases) or view the [latest commits](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/compare/7.2.2...7.3.0). Some of the highlights:

## Improving testing

We have been investing _lots_ of time into our test suites, with around 36 commits, 112 files changed, 3314 insertions and 2064 deletions made about this topic. We have:

* Migrated from Travis CI to [Github Actions](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/actions/workflows/ci.yml), which has improved the speed, throughput and reliability of our CI.
* Rewrote [TESTING.md](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/TESTING.md) documentation.
* Upgraded eslint configuration in order to use ES6 syntax within our tests. Feel free to incorporate newer syntax (such as `async/await`) into your new tests contributions.
* Fixed bugs in CI configuration: ADAPTERS and GREP variables weren't working correctly, background servers being started incorrectly, build failure caused by an older version of pouchdb-express-router.
* Unified the configuration variables used in the build.
* Fix the majority of non-deterministic tests to substantially reduce random failure during CI runs, and put in tooling for retrying failed tasks. This includes improving tests that check behaviour for unreachable servers, which previously relied on a third party service being available.
* Restructured the CI tasks so that each task exercises a single backend (i.e. CouchDB server version or client-side PouchDB adapter), rather than some combination of local and remote adapters. This reduces the impact of flaky tests, reduces the duration of each task, reduces redundant tasks repeating the same work, and allows more parallelisation of tests.
* Improved the test coverage across target platforms, including cross-browser tests, different Node.js versions, and different CouchDB versions. We have fixed tests that assume CouchDB v1.x behaviour so that they now work on v2.x and v3.x.
* Allowed the indexeddb adapter to be loaded and used during tests

## Add `indexeddb` adapter in the default distribution

The indexeddb adapter is now available in the default distribution. You can use it specifying the adapter:

```js
PouchDB.plugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-indexeddb'));
const db = new PouchDB('mydb', {adapter: 'indexeddb'});
```

Please note that it is considered BETA quality, use it carefully and please [report](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/new) any issues you find. Thank you.

## Add `view_update_changes_batch_size`

[#8320](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8320) With `view_update_changes_batch_size`, we can now specify how many change records will be consumed at a time when rebuilding view indexes when the `query()` method is used.

## Support `partial_filter_selector`

[#8276](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8276) [#8277](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8277) Now PouchDB-find supports [`partial_filter_selector`](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.2.0/api/database/find.html#partial-indexes).

## Indexing event to show the progress of view updates

[#8321](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8321) We can now subscribe to an `indexing` event, which will emit a `progress` object containing the properties `view`, `last_seq`, `results_count` and `indexed_docs`.

## Checkpoint events during replication

[#8324](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8324) During replication, we can subscribe to `checkpoint` events, which will emit the following properties: `checkpoint`, `revs_diff`, `start_next_batch` and `pending_batch`.

## Add `style` to replication options

[#8380](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8380) [#8379](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8379) We expose changes feed `style` to replication options.

## Add `view_adapter` option

[#8335](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8335) `view_adapter` provides an option for the user to specify a separate adapter to store their view index in addition to the main adapter for their core data:

```js
const db = new PouchDB(DB_NAME, {adapter: 'indexeddb', view_adapter: 'memory'});
```

## Enable discussions and projects
