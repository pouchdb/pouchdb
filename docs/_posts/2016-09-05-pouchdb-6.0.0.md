title: PouchDB 6.0.0: Labour Day
author: Dale Harvey

---

To celebrate the USA and Canada's Labo(u)r Day we have decided to work extra hard to bring
you PouchDB 6.0.0 which brings early retirement to those features that have done great
work over the years but whose services are no longer necessary (don't worry, we will pay
their pensions in full).

Along with the removed features we have a large list of bugfixes, documentation
work and general improvements for you to enjoy with your BBQ.

### Removed Features

PouchDB 5.4.0 introduces some deprecations. In 6.0 we have now removed these
features permanently:

* ([#5154](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/5154)) - Remove db.put(doc, id, rev)

Please use `db.put({_id: id, _rev: rev, data: 'foo'})` instead.

* ([#5251](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/5251)) - Remove `new PouchDB(dbName).then`

The constructor is now stateless. If you need to test whether setup can complete
then `new PouchDB(dbName).info()` can do that for you.

* ([#5519](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/5591)) - Remove extras API
* ([#5591](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/5519)) - Remove sqlite plugin support

Please use the [pouchdb-adapter-cordova-sqlite](https://github.com/nolanlawson/pouchdb-adapter-cordova-sqlite/blob/master/README.md) plugin instead.

* ([#5435](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/5435)) - Remove getHost
