Besides a slew of bugfixes and the new `revs_limit` feature, the big news about 5.2.0 is that PouchDB is now authored with ES6 modules rather than CommonJS. Using [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/), it's transpiled into CommonJS as one big `index.js` for Node and an `index-browser.js` for Webpack/Browserify.

The most immediate benefit is that you can expect PouchDB to take up 3KB less than before (a 6.7% reduction in size!) with no loss of functionality. This is thanks to Rollup's ability to remove the typical Browserify/Webpack cruft by [hoisting all submodules into a single scope](https://github.com/nolanlawson/rollup-comparison).

Another benefit is that PouchDB is now insulated from subtle differences between build systems like Browserify, Webpack, Babel, and Rollup itself. This is an esoteric problem for JavaScript module distribution, but I think it's worth going into detail, because it affects more libraries than just PouchDB.

I'll explore that topic later on, but first, here's the full changelog for 5.2.0:

### PouchDB and JavaScript build systems

To explain why we're now using Rollup to bundle one big `index.js` for Node, we'll need to take a look at the open-source JavaScript landscape, as it stands in 2016.

I've been working on PouchDB for about two years. In that short amount of time, I've seen the frontend ecosystem largely transition from prebuilt `<script>`-ready JavaScript files (usually distributed via Bower, CDN, or direct download) to Node modules distributed by npm and directly consumed by build tools like Browserify, Webpack, Babel, Grunt, Gulp, etc.

A big impact of this is that library authors no longer have control over the "last mile." Whereas our code used to be plopped directly into an HTML page (or merely concatenated), nowadays it's often parsed, chopped up, and transformed before it reaches that HTML page. This process inevitably introduces bugs and inconsistencies.

For instance, PouchDB has been [struggling with Webpack support](https://gist.github.com/nolanlawson/e5e3b3856f1a8347f277) for much of the past year. The number of times we've had Webpack-related bugs filed on us, and the number of times we've later regressed because we only test with Browserify, eventually compelled us to [test Webpack separately](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/4701). This means we're essentially testing both Browserify and Webpack as build targets.

Think this sounds extreme? Consider this example.

#### Example 1: requiring JSON

Let's say you added this innocent line of code to your JavaScript library:

```js
MyLibrary.version = require('./package.json').version;
```

This will work in Browserify and Node, but it will break in Webpack unless the end-user adds a special [json-loader](https://github.com/webpack/json-loader) to their Webpack configuration. 

Does your library do this? Do you have a _dependency_ that does this? Then congratulations, you cannot fix this for your users. All you can do is document it in your README and/or endure the inevitable bug reports.

This is not something Webpack intends to fix, since it seems to constitute a philosophical difference between Browserify and Webpack. Their argument is that end-users should have control over how libraries are built. (You can read [this discussion](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/378) for details.)

#### Example 2: Browserify transforms

Another good example of Browserify/Webpack differences is [Browserify transforms](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/wiki/list-of-transforms). These are modules that can transform your library at build time, when it's consumed by Browserify.

Transforms are very popular in the Browserify ecosystem, but unfortunately they don't work in Webpack unless you use the [transform-loader](https://github.com/webpack/transform-loader). Worse, this is another thing that end-users are expected to configure for every dependency (and every dependency of a dependency&hellip;).

So if your project is built with Browserify, it's easy to accidentally add a Browserify transform, while forgetting that it will break for Webpack users. (We nearly made that mistake ourselves, before we started testing Webpack.) So the only reasonable choice for library authors is to avoid Browserify transforms entirely.

#### Example 3: strict mode

To stop picking on Webpack for a bit, I also [recently blogged about a bug](http://nolanlawson.com/2015/12/28/how-to-fix-a-bug-in-an-open-source-project/) in the ["buffer" project](https://github.com/feross/buffer) that was caused by Babel re-interpreting the code as strict, even though it was not distributed in strict mode. This is another great example of a "last mile" bug that ended up being something the library author needed to deal with.

Of course, in this case, the library author could have just said "not my bug." But then the Babel authors might have (quite reasonably) responded, "your library should be strict; we don't support non-strict code," at which point it would become a game of hot potato. And all the while, end-users would be adding messy hacks to their build scripts to work around the issue.

#### Lessons from the browser world

This story should be familiar. We've been here before. JavaScript developers have always had to struggle with a hostile and unpredictable environment, which required us to write robust code that could anticipate bugs and implementation differences. Of course, I'm talking about the browser.

Now, I won't argue that writing code for Browserify, Webpack, Babel, and friends is nearly as difficult as writing code for a half-dozen browsers, but it's definitely getting there. So in my opinion, the only reasonable solution is to start bundling code before distribution on NPM, which is desirable anyway since we have so many nice tools for transpiling future JavaScript to browser-safe ES5 (such as Babel itself).

The benefits are clear: we can use Browserify transforms and `require('./package.json')` and whatever else we want, as long as they're only _compile steps_ that build a bundle to be consumed by Node (and therefore Browserify/Webpack). As a bonus, this allows us to build a smaller and sleeker bundle, which is also faster for the end-user to build, since most of the build steps have already been run in advance.

I believe most JavaScript libraries are already moving in this direction, so this puts PouchDB firmly in that bandwagon. But to be clear: we don't intend to start using all the various experimental ES6/ES7 features in PouchDB. In fact, we are _only_ transforming ES6 modules into CommonJS ; in all other ways, PouchDB is still standard ES5. The reason we're doing this is that transpiled ES5 is often cruftier than hand-written ES5. So for now, we're avoiding it.

The goal of implementing CouchDB in JavaScript has always been an ambitious one. The fact that we've done so in ~45KB is an even more impressive accomplishment. But despite the challenges, we're going to keep the bar high; we even have [a CI test](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/541867814da313855bd802cdc87cce8fcfb12320/bin/verify-bundle-size.sh) that fails if our minified bundle ever exceeds 50KB.

Along those same lines, we also have an [open issue](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/4449) to add the ability to create custom builds (e.g. no WebSQL, no map/reduce, no replication, etc.). Presumably this can be made even easier with Rollup's tree-shaking capabilities, but we're still investigating this feature.
