title: PouchDB 4.0.2 - A Little Extra
author: Nolan Lawson

---

4.0.2 is a quick update to sneak in some important bugfixes in anticipation of the next monthly release.

The most visible change in 4.0.2 is the long-awaited upgrade of `levelup` and `leveldown` to 1.x ([#3873](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/3873)), which contains some big improvements to how `leveldown` is installed. With 4.0.2, instead of needing to recompile `leveldown` every time PouchDB is `npm install`ed, it will simply be downloaded thanks to [leveldown-prebuilt](https://github.com/mafintosh/leveldown-prebuilt). So if you've ever groaned at the dreaded `node-gyp rebuild` console message, hop onto 4.0.2 and enjoy the faster install times!

Also noteworthy is that the in-memory adapter is now fully tested and working in IE 10+, thanks to fixes in [#4216](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/4216).

Another big change is that PouchDB is more stable when replicating during intermittent connectivity, thanks to a new "stateless constructor" in the HTTP adapter ([#4146](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/4146)). Instead of kicking off HTTP requests immediately when you call `new PouchDB('http://example.com/db')`, the new version will wait for the first method call, such as `db.info()`.
