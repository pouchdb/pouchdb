title: PouchDB 8.0.0 — Modernizing PouchDB
author: Alba Herrerías

---

We are thrilled to announce the release of PouchDB's new major version 8.0.0. For a full changelog from 7.3.1 to 8.0.0, please see [the releases page](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases) or view the [latest commits](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/compare/7.3.1...8.0.0). Here are the highlights:

## Embracing modern ES6+ JS syntax

We have started the process of moving to ES6+ syntax. We made refactors to use native JS classes instead of prototypes, deprecated some packages that implemented features that are now built in the language ([`inherits`](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/commit/50d2c33a9c262b0d44c39abb5c40c6685e3fcd8e), [`argsarray`](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/commit/4974b64a67723fc8ec2d471c0590502dfe104760)), and started in packages such as `pouchdb-abstract-mapreduce` and `pouchdb-adapter-http`. We encourage you to embrace the syntax in your new contributions and, if you can, contribute to the refactoring effort. 

This might mean a **potentially breaking change**, therefore we bump the major version. If you need to support ES5 we recommend you use a transpiler. 

## Add `activeTasks`

[#8422](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8422) [#8441](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8441) Analogous to the `_active_tasks` feature in CouchDB, PouchDB now has `activeTasks`. With this functionality, PouchDB is able to list all active database tasks, like `database_compaction`, `view_indexing`, or `replication`. PouchDB will report the progress of these tasks to the active tasks API and remove tasks as soon as they are completed or have failed.

Example usage:
```js
let tasks = PouchDB.activeTasks.list()
```

Example result:

```js
[{
  "id": "d81fea92-8ce4-42df-bb2b-89a4e67536c3",
  "name": "database_compaction",
  "created_at": "2022-02-08T15:38:45.318Z",
  "total_items": 12,
  "completed_items": 1,
  "updated_at": "2022-02-08T15:38:45.821Z"
}]
```

## Add `purge` to the `indexeddb` adapter

[#8453](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8453) Similar to CouchDB's `purge`, PouchDB has now `purge` for its `indexeddb` adapter.

Purge permanently removes data from the database. Normal deletion with `db.remove()` does not, it only marks the document as `_deleted=true` and creates a new revision. This behaviour ensures that deletes can be replicated across databases, and deleted documents don’t get undeleted by syncing with a database that still has this document.

`db.purge()` is not intended as a regular method for deleting documents, instead, it is meant as an admin function for cases where some secret was erroneously added to the database and must now be removed completely, eg. a credit card or social security number. Purge effectively puts the database in a state where the offending write never happened.

Example usage:

```js
try {
  const result = await db.purge('mydoc', '6-3a24009a9525bde9e4bfa8a99046b00d');
  // handle result
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

Example result:

```js
{
  "ok": true,
  "deletedRevs": [
    "6-3a24009a9525bde9e4bfa8a99046b00d",
    "5-df4a81cd21c75c71974d96e88a68fc2f"
  ],
  "documentWasRemovedCompletely": false
}
```

## Improving publishing packages
[#8576](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8576) Previously, if publishing packages failed part-way through, the release script halt and the remaining packages needed to be published by hand. With this improvement the script can be run again to publish the remaining packages.
