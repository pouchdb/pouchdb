author: Garren Smith

We have another PouchDB release. The main improvements in this release are bug fixes and dependency updates.
For a full changelog from 7.0 to 7.1.1, please see [the releases page](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases) or view the [latest commits](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/compare/7.0.0...7.1.1).


## Get in touch

As always, we welcome feedback from the community and would love to hear what you think of this release as well as PouchDB's future direction. Please don't hesitate to [file issues](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues) or [get in touch](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#get-in-touch). And of course, a big thanks to all of our [new and existing contributors](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/graphs/contributors)!

If you wondering where is 7.1.0, I had a slight publishing issue so the easiest was to bump it up to 7.1.1 to do a fresh deploy.
