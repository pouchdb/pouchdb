I'm happy to announce the release of PouchDB 6.4.0, bringing in a number of important features and fixes. For a full changelog from 6.3.0 to 6.4.0 please see [the releases page](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases). Some of the highlights:

## Add update_seq option to `allDocs()` and `query()`

[#6230](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/6230) - Dale Harders added support for passing `update_seq: true` to either `allDocs()` or `query()` or will return the current databases `update_seq`.

## Add pending pending property

[#5710](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/5710) - Dale also added support for passing through the `pending` property newly implemented in CouchDB that reports the number of pending documents to replicate.

## Use a single transaction for allDocs with keys requests

[#6854](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/6854) - [@nename0](https://github.com/nename0) implemented an optimisation to use a single transaction in indexedDB and WebSQL for allDocs requests with keys. This seen a huge 8X speedup in Chrome and 2X in Firefox.

## Add support to store cookies on Node.js

[#6814](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/6814) - [@ptitjes](https://github.com/ptitjes) fixed HTTP requests in Node.JS to ensure they use a cookie jar.
