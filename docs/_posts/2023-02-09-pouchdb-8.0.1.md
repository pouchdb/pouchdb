The first release of the year! This is a patch release, it fixes a bug we introduced during a refactor made in the last release and sets Node 14 in our CI.

## Fix `this` of `changesHandler`
[#8583](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8583) [#8581](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/8581) We introduced a bug in the [#8450](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8450) refactor that has been fixed now. 

## Use Node 14
[#8570](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/8570) We were testing our CI in GHA against Node 12, which is EOL. Now we are testing against Node 14.
