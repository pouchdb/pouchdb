Hello World! Welcome to the newly formed PouchDB blog. PouchDB has been an active community for over 2 years now, with almost everything being run via IRC and Github. As the project grows, we wanted a way to communicate with users about the current state of the PouchDB world.

We will obviously be posting updates and releases notes for PouchDB releases, but as well as that, we will also be blogging about related projects and technologies within the PouchDB world, such as Service Workers, CouchDB, etc.

As with the PouchDB source, we would love to invite everyone to contribute.  We have [documented the instructions](https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-a-pouchdb-blog-post), so please get involved.

Over the last 4 years PouchDB has had 89 [awesome contributors](https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/graphs/contributors). I would like to give a shout-out to the people who worked together to get this site up and running in such a short time: [nickcolley](https://twitter.com/NickColley), [misosoup](https://twitter.com/misosoup), [zaccolley](https://twitter.com/zaccolley), [nolanlawson](https://twitter.com/nolanlawson) and [virgie](https://github.com/virgie) in particular.

Happy Pouching.
