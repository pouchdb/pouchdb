Writing a plugin is easy! The API is:

{% highlight js %}
PouchDB.plugin({
  methodName: myFunction
});
{% endhighlight %}

This will add a `db.methodName()` to all databases, which runs `myFunction`.It will always be called in context, so that within the function, `this` refers to the database object.

There is a [PouchDB Plugin Seed project](https://github.com/pouchdb/plugin-seed), which is the fastest way to get started writing, building and testing your very own plugin.

#### Example Usage:
{% highlight js %}
PouchDB.plugin({
  sayHello : function () {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
});
new PouchDB('foobar').sayHello(); // prints "Hello!"
{% endhighlight %}

### Extra APIs

In order to reduce code size when your plugin is browserified/webpacked, PouchDB exposes some of its internal modules to plugin authors.

To use them, you should save PouchDB as a required npm dependency (`npm install --save pouchdb`) and then require them like so:

#### Ajax

{% highlight js %}
var ajax = require('pouchdb/extras/ajax');
{% endhighlight %}

The `ajax()` function as used by PouchDB. Essentially a shim in the style of `jQuery.ajax`.

#### Checkpointer

{% highlight js %}
var Checkpointer = require('pouchdb/extras/checkpointer');
{% endhighlight %}

The `Checkpointer` function as used by PouchDB's replicator. Writes checkpoints as `_local` docs so that replication can resume where it last left off.

#### Promise

{% highlight js %}
var Promise = require('pouchdb/extras/promise');
{% endhighlight %}

The ES6 `Promise` shim as used by PouchDB. Expect this to be `bluebird` in Node, `lie` in browsers without Promise support, and the global `Promise` in browsers with Promise support.

#### Caveats

These "extras" should not be considered stable parts of the API, and may change unpredictably between PouchDB versions. Refer to the [source code](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/tree/master/extras) for the details of the API.

If your plugin depends on a particular version of PouchDB, please notify your users. Unless you like to live dangerously, you should also nail down the version of PouchDB you are using in your `package.json`. And if you need any other internal modules, please submit a pull request.
