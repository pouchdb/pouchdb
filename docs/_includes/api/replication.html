{% highlight js %}
PouchDB.replicate(source, target, [options])
{% endhighlight %}

Replicate data from `source` to `target`.  Both the `source` and `target` can be a PouchDB instance or a string representing a CouchDB database URL or the name of a local PouchDB database. If `options.live` is `true`, then this will track future changes and also replicate them automatically. This method returns an object with the method `cancel()`, which you call if you want to cancel live replication.

Replication is an [event emitter][] like [changes()](#changes) and emits the `'complete'`, `'active'`, `'paused'`, `'change'`, `'denied'` and `'error'` events.

### Options

All options default to `false` unless otherwise specified.

* `options.live`: If `true`, starts subscribing to future changes in the `source` database and continue replicating them.
* `options.retry`: If `true` will attempt to retry replications in the case of failure (due to being offline), using a backoff algorithm that retries at longer and longer intervals until a connection is re-established. Only applicable if `options.live` is also `true`.
* `options.filter`: Reference a filter function from a design document to selectively get updates.
* `options.query_params`: Query params sent to the filter function.
* `options.doc_ids`: Only replicate docs with these ids (array of strings).
* `options.since`: Replicate changes after the given sequence number.
* `options.create_target`: Create target database if it does not exist. Only for server replications.
* `options.batch_size`: Number of documents to process at a time. Defaults to 100. This affects the number of docs held in memory and the number sent at a time to the target server. You may need to adjust downward if targeting devices with low amounts of memory (e.g. phones) or if the documents are large in size (e.g. with attachments). If your documents are small in size, then increasing this number will probably speed replication up.
* `options.batches_limit`: Number of batches to process at a time. Defaults to 10. This (along wtih `batch_size`) controls how many docs are kept in memory at a time, so the maximum docs in memory at once would equal `batch_size` &times; `batches_limit`.

#### Example Usage:

{% highlight js %}
var rep = PouchDB.replicate('mydb', 'http://localhost:5984/mydb', {
  live: true,
  retry: true
}).on('change', function (info) {
  // handle change
}).on('paused', function () {
  // replication paused (e.g. user went offline)
}).on('active', function () {
  // replicate resumed (e.g. user went back online)
}).on('denied', function (info) {
  // a document failed to replicate, e.g. due to permissions
}).on('complete', function (info) {
  // handle complete
}).on('error', function (err) {
  // handle error
});

rep.cancel(); // whenever you want to cancel
{% endhighlight %}

There are also shorthands for replication given existing PouchDB objects. These behave the same as `PouchDB.replicate()`:

{% highlight js %}
db.replicate.to(remoteDB, [options]);
// or
db.replicate.from(remoteDB, [options]);
{% endhighlight %}

The `remoteDB` can either be a string or a `PouchDB` object. If you have special ajax options on a remote database, you will want to use `PouchDB` objects instead of strings, so that the options are used.

#### Replication events

* __`change`__ (`info`) - This event fires when the replication has written a new document. `info` will contain details about the change. `info.doc` will contain the doc if you set `include_docs` to `true`. See below for an example response.
* __`complete`__ (`info`) - This event fires when replication is completed or cancelled. In a live replication, only cancelling the replication should trigger this event. `info` will contain details about the replication. See below for an example response.
* __`paused`__ (`err`) - This event fires when the replication is paused, either because a live replication is waiting for changes, or replication has temporarily failed, with `err`, and is attempting to resume.
* __`active`__ - This event fires when the replication starts actively processing changes; e.g. when it recovers from an error or new changes are available.
* __`denied`__ (`err`) - This event fires if a document failed to replicate due to validation or authorization errors.
* __`error`__ (`err`) - This event is fired when the replication is stopped due to an unrecoverable failure. If `retry` is `false`, this will also fire when the user goes offline or another network error occurs (so you can handle retries yourself, if you want).
* __`uptodate`__ (*deprecated*) - This event fires when a live replication has caught up and is waiting on future changes. This should be replaced by using the `paused` event.

#### Single-shot

As with [changes()](#changes), you can also omit `live`, in which case you can use `replicate()` in the callback/promise style and it will be treated as a single-shot operation.

{% include code/start.html id="replication1" type="callback" %}
{% highlight js %}
db.replicate.to(remote, function (err, result) {
  if (err) { return console.log(err); }
  // handle 'completed' result
});
{% endhighlight %}
{% include code/end.html %}
{% include code/start.html id="replication1" type="promise" %}
{% highlight js %}
db.replicate.to(remote).then(function (result) {
  // handle 'completed' result
}).catch(function (err) {
  console.log(err);
});
{% endhighlight %}
{% include code/end.html %}

For non-live replications, the returned object is also an event emitter as well as a promise, and you can use all the events described above (except for `'paused'` and `'active'`, which only apply to `retry` replications).

#### Example Response:

Example response in the `'change'` listener:

{% highlight js %}
{
  "doc_write_failures": 0,
  "docs_read": 1,
  "docs_written": 1,
  "errors": [],
  "last_seq": 1,
  "ok": true,
  "start_time": "Fri May 16 2014 18:23:12 GMT-0700 (PDT)"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Example response in the `'complete'` listener:

{% highlight js %}
{
  "doc_write_failures": 0,
  "docs_read": 2,
  "docs_written": 2,
  "end_time": "Fri May 16 2014 18:26:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)",
  "errors": [],
  "last_seq": 2,
  "ok": true,
  "start_time": "Fri May 16 2014 18:26:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)",
  "status": "complete"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that replication is supported for both local and remote databases. So you can replicate from local to local or from remote to remote.

However, if you replicate from remote to remote, then the changes will flow through PouchDB. If you want to trigger a server-initiated replication, please use regular ajax to POST to the CouchDB `_replicate` endpoint, as described [in the CouchDB docs](https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Replication).
