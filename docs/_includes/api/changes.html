{% include anchor.html title="Listen to database changes" hash="changes" %} 

{% highlight js %}
db.changes(options)
{% endhighlight %}

A list of changes made to documents in the database, in the order they were made.
It returns an object with the method `cancel()`, which you call if you don't want to listen to new changes anymore.

It is an [event emitter][event emitter] and will emit a `'change'` event on each document change, a `'complete'` event when all the changes have been processed, and an `'error'` event when an error occurs. In addition to the `'change'` event, any change will also emit a `'create'`, `'update'`, or `'delete'` event.

### Options

All options default to `false` unless otherwise specified.

* `options.include_docs`: Include the associated document with each change.
  * `options.conflicts`: Include conflicts.
  * `options.attachments`: Include attachments.
* `options.descending`: Reverse the order of the output documents.
* `options.since`: Start the results from the change immediately after the given sequence number. You can also pass 'now' if you want only new changes (when `live` is `true`).
* `options.live`: Uses the  `_longpoll_` feed.
* `options.timeout`: Request timeout (in milliseconds).
* `options.limit`: Limit the number of results to this number.
* `options.doc_ids`: Only show changes for docs with these ids (array of strings).
* `options.filter`: Reference a filter function from a design document to selectively get updates. To use a view function, pass `_view` here and provide a reference to the view function in `options.view`.
* `options.query_params`: Object containing properties that are passed to the filter function, e.g. `{"foo:"bar"}`, where `"bar"` will be available in the filter function as `params.query.foo`. To access the `params`, define your filter function like `function (doc, params) {/* ... */}`.
* `options.view`: Specify a view function (e.g. `'design_doc_name/view_name'`) to act as a filter. Documents counted as "passed" for a view filter if a map function emits at least one record for them. **Note**: `options.filter` must be set to `'_view'` for this option to work.
* `options.returnDocs`: Is available for non-http databases and defaults to `true`. Passing `false` prevents the changes feed from keeping all the documents in memory &ndash; in other words complete always has an empty results array, and the `change` event is the only way to get the event. Useful for large change sets where otherwise you would run out of memory.
* `options.batch_size`: Only available for http databases, this configures how many changes to fetch at a time. Increasing this can reduce the number of requests made. Default is 25.
* `options.style`: Specifies how many revisions are returned in the changes array. The default, `'main_only'`, will only return the current "winning" revision; `'all_docs'` will return all leaf revisions (including conflicts and deleted former conflicts). Most likely you won't need this unless you're writing a replicator.

#### Example Usage:

{% highlight js %}
var changes = db.changes({
  since: 'now',
  live: true,
  include_docs: true
}).on('create', function (info) {
  // document was created
}).on('update', function (info) {
  // document was updated
}).on('delete', function (info) {
  // document was deleted
}).on('change', function(info) {
  // any document was created/updated/deleted
}).on('complete', function(info) {
  // changes() was canceled
}).on('error', function (err) {
  console.log(err);
});

changes.cancel(); // whenever you want to cancel
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example Response:
{% highlight js %}
{
  "id":"somestuff",
  "seq":21,
  "changes":[{
    "rev":"1-8e6e4c0beac3ec54b27d1df75c7183a8"
  }],
  "doc":{
    "title":"Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes",
    "_id":"someDocId",
    "_rev":"1-8e6e4c0beac3ec54b27d1df75c7183a8"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Change events

* __`change`__ (`info`) - This event fires when a change has been found. `info` will contain details about the change, such as whether it was deleted and what the new `_rev` is. `info.doc` will contain the doc if you set `include_docs` to `true`. `info.deleted` will be `true` if the document was deleted. (See below for an example response.) When a `'change'` event fires, one of the three of `'create'`/`'update'`/`'delete'` events will also fire, emitting the same `info`.
* __`create`__ (`info`) - Event indicating a new document was created.
* __`update`__ (`info`) - Event indicating a document was updated.
* __`delete`__ (`info`) - Event indicating a document was deleted.
* __`complete`__ (`info`) - This event fires when all changes have been read. In live changes, only cancelling the changes should trigger this event. `info.results` will contain the list of changes. See below for an example.
* __`error`__ (`err`) - This event is fired when the replication is stopped due to an unrecoverable failure.

#### Example response

Example response in the `'change'` listener (using `{include_docs: true}`):

{% highlight js %}
{ id: 'doc1',
  changes: [ { rev: '1-9152679630cc461b9477792d93b83eae' } ],
  doc: { 
    _id: 'doc1', 
    _rev: '1-9152679630cc461b9477792d93b83eae' 
  },
  seq: 1 
} 
{% endhighlight %}

Example response in the `'change'` listener when a doc was deleted:

{% highlight js %}
{ id: 'doc2',
  changes: [ { rev: '2-9b50a4b63008378e8d0718a9ad05c7af' } ],
  doc: { _id: 'doc2',
    _rev: '2-9b50a4b63008378e8d0718a9ad05c7af',
    _deleted: true 
  },
  deleted: true,
  seq: 3
}
{% endhighlight %}

Example response in the `'complete'` listener:

{% highlight js %}
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "doc1",
      "changes": [ { "rev": "1-9152679630cc461b9477792d93b83eae" } ],
      "doc": {
        "_id": "doc1",
        "_rev": "1-9152679630cc461b9477792d93b83eae"
      },
      "seq": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "doc2",
      "changes": [ { "rev": "2-9b50a4b63008378e8d0718a9ad05c7af" } ],
      "doc": {
        "_id": "doc2",
        "_rev": "2-9b50a4b63008378e8d0718a9ad05c7af",
        "_deleted": true
      },
      "deleted": true,
      "seq": 3
    }
  ],
  "last_seq": 3
}
{% endhighlight %}

`seq` and `last_seq` correspond to the overall sequence number of the entire database, and it's what is passed in when using `since` (except for the special `'now'`). It is the primary key for the changes feed, and is also used as a checkpointer by the replication algorithm.

#### Single-shot

If you don't specify `{live: true}`, then you can also use `changes()` in the standard
callback/promise style, and it will be treated as a single-shot request, which
returns a list of the changes (i.e. what the `'complete'` event emits):

{% include code/start.html id="changes1" type="callback" %}
{% highlight js %}
db.changes({
  limit: 10,
  since: 0
}, function (err, response) {
  if (err) { return console.log(err); }
  // handle result
});
{% endhighlight %}
{% include code/end.html %}
{% include code/start.html id="changes1" type="promise" %}
{% highlight js %}
db.changes({
  limit: 10,
  since: 0
}).then(function (result) {
  // handle result
}).catch(function (err) {
  console.log(err);
});
{% endhighlight %}
{% include code/end.html %}

#### Example Response:

{% highlight js %}
{
  "results": [{
    "id": "0B3358C1-BA4B-4186-8795-9024203EB7DD",
    "seq": 1,
    "changes": [{
      "rev": "1-5782E71F1E4BF698FA3793D9D5A96393"
    }]
  }, {
    "id": "mydoc",
    "seq": 2,
    "changes": [{
      "rev": "1-A6157A5EA545C99B00FF904EEF05FD9F"
    }]
  }, {
    "id": "otherdoc",
    "seq": 3,
    "changes": [{
      "rev": "1-3753476B70A49EA4D8C9039E7B04254C"
    }]
  }, {
    "id": "828124B9-3973-4AF3-9DFD-A94CE4544005",
    "seq": 4,
    "changes": [{
      "rev": "1-A8BC08745E62E58830CA066D99E5F457"
    }]
  }]
}
{% endhighlight %}

When `live` is `false`, the returned object is also an event emitter as well as a promise,
and will fire the `'complete'` event when the results are ready.

Note that this `'complete'` event only fires when you aren't doing live changes. With live changes, use the `'paused'` event instead.
