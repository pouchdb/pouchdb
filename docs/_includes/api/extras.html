PouchDB offers some "extra" APIs that are designed for PouchDB plugin authors, or for those who want to use non-standard adapters like in-memory and LocalStorage.

These can be especially useful when you are using [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)/[Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), because they can reduce your overall code size by deduplicating packages. If you're not using Browserify/Webpack, you can also download them [as standalone scripts](/adapters.html#pouchdb_in_the_browser).

### Browser adapter plugins

These adapters are alternatives to PouchDB's built-in IndexedDB/WebSQL adapters. They fully pass the PouchDB test suite.

#### LocalStorage adapter

{% highlight js %}
var PouchDB = require('pouchdb');
require('pouchdb/extras/localstorage');

var db = new PouchDB('mydb', {adapter: 'localstorage'});
{% endhighlight %}

PouchDB adapter using [LocalStorage](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/). Intended for browsers and environments that don't support IndexedDB or WebSQL. Based on [localstorage-down](https://github.com/No9/localstorage-down).

You can also download this plugin [as a standalone script](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases/download/{{ site.version }}/pouchdb.localstorage.js).

#### In-memory adapter

{% highlight js %}
var PouchDB = require('pouchdb');
require('pouchdb/extras/memory');

var db = new PouchDB('mydb', {adapter: 'memory'});
{% endhighlight %}

Fully in-memory PouchDB adapter. Data will not be saved after a browser refresh!

This adapter can be useful for unit tests or for environments that don't support IndexedDB/WebSQL. Based on [MemDOWN](https://github.com/Level/memdown).

You can also download this plugin [as a standalone script](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases/download/{{ site.version }}/pouchdb.memory.js).

{% include alert/start.html variant="warning"%}
{% markdown %}

If you want to use an in-memory PouchDB in Node.js/io.js, you should [directly require MemDOWN instead](/adapters.html#pouchdb_in_node_js).

{% endmarkdown %}
{% include alert/end.html%}

#### Alternative IndexedDB adapter

{% highlight js %}
var PouchDB = require('pouchdb');
require('pouchdb/extras/idb-alt');

var db = new PouchDB('mydb', {adapter: 'idb-alt'});
{% endhighlight %}

PouchDB adapter using [level-js](https://github.com/maxogden/level.js) over IndexedDB as a storage backend. Mostly only interesting to PouchDB developers; someday, this may replace the standard IndexedDB adapter.

You can also download this plugin [as a standalone script](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases/download/{{ site.version }}/pouchdb.idb-alt.js).

{% include alert/start.html variant="info"%}
{% markdown %}

When you include these plugins in your project, they will be automatically picked up as a "third" option when you create a new PouchDB without an adapter specified (e.g. `new PouchDB('mydb')`).

So for instance, if the user loads PouchDB in a browser that does not support WebSQL or IndexedDB, and if you are using the in-memory plugin, then PouchDB will automatically use the memory adapter instead of WebSQL or IndexedDB.

{% endmarkdown %}
{% include alert/end.html%}

### APIs for plugin authors

These APIs are designed for PouchDB plugin authors, who may want to re-use some PouchDB code to avoid duplication. 

To use these APIs, you should save PouchDB as a required npm dependency (`npm install --save pouchdb`) and then require them like so:

#### Ajax

{% highlight js %}
var ajax = require('pouchdb/extras/ajax');
{% endhighlight %}

The `ajax()` function as used by PouchDB. Essentially a shim in the style of `jQuery.ajax`.

#### Checkpointer

{% highlight js %}
var Checkpointer = require('pouchdb/extras/checkpointer');
{% endhighlight %}

The `Checkpointer` function as used by PouchDB's replicator. Writes checkpoints as `_local` docs so that replication can resume where it last left off.

#### Promise

{% highlight js %}
var Promise = require('pouchdb/extras/promise');
{% endhighlight %}

The ES6 `Promise` shim as used by PouchDB. Expect this to be `lie` where a global `Promise` does not exist, the global `Promise` is used when supported.

#### Caveats

These APIs are not rigorously documented and may change frequently. Refer to the [source code](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/tree/master/extras) for the details of the APIs.

If your plugin depends on a particular version of PouchDB, please notify your users. Unless you like to live dangerously, you should also nail down the version of PouchDB you are using in your `package.json`. And if you need any other internal modules, please submit a pull request!
