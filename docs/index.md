# PouchDB

PouchDB is a JavaScript library that allows you to store and query data for web applications that need to work offline, and sync with an online database when you are online.

### The Browser Database that Syncs

Based on the work of Apache CouchDB, PouchDB provides a simple API in which to store and retrieve JSON objects, due to the similiar API, and CouchDB's HTTP API it is possible to sync data that is stored in your local PouchDB to an online CouchDB as well as syncing data from CouchDB down to PouchDB (you can even sync between 2 PouchDB databases).

### Status & Browser Support

 * Firefox 12+
 * Chrome 19+
 * node.js

Support for WebSQL which provides support for Opera, Safari and Mobile Safari is in progress.
